### Overview of the statistical analysis

## The purpose of the analysis is well define

# Anaysis in Trip Duration and Gender with weekday and hour. This is intended to want find which is the most hour for trip and which is the male or female?

### Results

## There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis

# I have a seven visulizations for charts

## There is a description of the results for each visualization

# 1. counts for number of rides in 60 minutes and 140k at first zero tripduration after 1 and 2 fall to zero for number of ride. 2. MALE is higher at first, and female is low. after male falling join with female flat. 3. popular trips at 4-6pm and 6am-9am. 4. female is low and very light. for male is dark gold at 4-6pm and 6-9am. 5. male subscriber is dark blue for 7 days and female is light blue. So Female is not much trip bike. for male do much trip bike because show color of dark mean popular.

### Summary

## There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis

# The summary is anaysis found the result about trips. I see the most male is trip, and not much female. Also time most about 5-9am and 6-9pm. I think this make sense time because before and after for work. I would like to add two additional is pie charts because we can see percent of pie for male and female. Also perecent of each hour in pie chart. I think this is great pie chart of percent.
